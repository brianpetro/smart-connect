### How to use
When Smart Connect is running and connected then Smart Actions can be used from any device.
## Smart Actions
### Core Actions
Core Actions are implemented by the core development team. These actions ship with Smart Connect by default. Core actions are design to be extended by custom & community actions and personalized prompts.
*These actions have the highest safety rating.*
### Community Actions (coming soon!)
Community Actions are easily available and installed from within the Smart Connect community index. These actions must be open-source and pass an approval process for inclusion in the community index.
*These actions are considered safe.*
### Custom actions
Custom Actions enable developers (or anyone that can produce a JavaScript function) to create and test actions.
See [this sample](https://github.com/brianpetro/Sample-Smart-Action) (more documentation coming soon!)
*Only use this feature to install your own custom actions.*
